# Numerical_methods

A collection of scripts for Numerical Methods, focused on solving mathematical problems using computational techniques. This repository is particularly useful for students and anyone interested in applied mathematics and numerical analysis.

Not all scripts work correctly.

## Example topics of scripts

- **Root finding algorithms**: methods like Newton-Raphson, bisection, and secant for solving equations.
- **Numerical integration**: techniques such as Simpson's rule, trapezoidal rule, and Gaussian quadrature.
- **Solving differential equations**: Euler’s method, Runge-Kutta methods, and other approaches for ODEs.
- **Linear algebra**: matrix operations, solving systems of equations, eigenvalue problems.
- **Interpolation and approximation**: polynomial interpolation, spline methods.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/filipmalecki94/Numerical_methods.git
   ```
2. Browse the scripts and open the one you are interested in.
3. Run the script using the recommended software (e.g., Mathematica, Python—depending on the script).

## Requirements

- Recommended: Mathematica (most scripts)
- Some scripts may require Python with libraries like numpy, scipy, matplotlib
